Hello welcome to my Employee Directory  Program!
- Using the program is simple just open all 6 java files and run CreateAndPrintStaff.java (main). 
- You should be prompted to enter an option of either 1. “Create Staff Record” or 2. 
“Print all Staff”. 
- By selecting “Create staff Record” you are given another option of what type of staff you are adding: Volunteer, executive , or hourly ( IMPORTANT: there will not be more than 3 of each type).
- By selecting which staff you wish to input , you are prompted to enter a name and other information pertaining to the staff.  (Each staff will have different information).
- Once you have finished creating your staff , it will be recorded in the database with its own number ID
- You now have the option to go back to the menu and add another staff or print all the staff that you have inputted.
